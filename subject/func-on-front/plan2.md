## what is programing

- it's a bout writng programs obviously

---

## then what is a program

- some intellignt definition from 

---

## my metaphor : a program is a recipe

- the ti punch program (very imerative style)
- a programm is supposed to be blindly respected (judgement day wont be happening tommorrow)
- there is actually a language called "chef" (makes your code look like a recipe)
- is this a good metaphor

---

## consider the following situation

- someone in a car wants to go from republique to bastille

---

## the recipe seems basic

- looking at the map, well it's straight on one street

---

## the driver can't blindly follow this recipe

- on his way he'll face various situation : red light, bycicles, people crossing....

--- 

## what's missing in my recipe ?

- another layer of instructions to tell th driver how react when some events occurs
- that's what traffic rules are (when light is red i do this...)
- that is another way to write programs

---

## 2 ways to give instructions : "recipe" VS "rules to handle events"

- the first one would be called imperative programming
- the second one would be event based programming which is reactive programming


these are called paradigms
even experienced people have trouble shifting paradidms according to the situation
currntly there is one good usecase for reactive programing : the front
analogy (the driver / the front)
alredy know the path once you give it to him / already know what to show if it's written (html)
need to add another layer of rules to tell how to react to events / need to add another layer of rules to tell how to react to events
traffic rules / your code (most of the time)

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning. (Rick Cook)

Programming is the act of installing internal, pre-established reactions to external stimuli so that a person will automatically react in a predetermined manner to things like an auditory, visual or tactile signal or perform a specific set of actions according to a date and/or time.”
